# Helmet Detection and Number Plate Capturing

## Overview

The "Helmet Detection and Number Plate Capturing" project aims to improve road safety by detecting if a motorcycle rider is wearing a helmet and capturing their license plate if they are not. This system processes video streams in real-time using computer vision and deep learning techniques, leveraging Python, OpenCV, and PyTorch.

## Features

- Real-time video processing
- Helmet detection using a pre-trained deep learning model
- License plate detection and recognition if no helmet is detected
- Efficient and accurate detection

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- Pillow
- SciPy
- CMake
- Dlib
